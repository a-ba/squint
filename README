INTRODUCTION

	squint is command that duplicates the output of a monitor into a X11
	window.


	The  very  purpose of such a gadget is to allow displaying a
	presentation (or making any kind of demonstration) on multiple monitors
	in the same time without cloning the entire screen. The laptop's panel
	remains fully available to do any other stuff. 

DEPENDENCIES
	
	Required:
		- gtk+ (>=3.0)
		- meson

	Optional (but recommended):
		- libayatana-appindicator3
		- libxdamage
		- libxfixes
		- libxi (>=1.5)
		- libxrandr
		- libxrender

		- txt2tags gzip  (for the man page)

INSTALLATION

	The build script is based on *meson*. To build squint (assuming you are
	using the ninja backend), you need to run:

		meson setup builddir
		ninja -C builddir
	
	Then install it with:

		ninja -C builddir install

	By default squint is installed into /usr/local. You use a different
	path by running "meson configure builddir --prefix=PATH" before the
	build.

	For more details, check the meson user manual at:
	https://mesonbuild.com/Running-Meson.html
