INTRODUCTION

	squint is command that duplicates the output of a monitor into a X11
	window.


	The  very  purpose of such a gadget is to allow displaying a
	presentation (or making any kind of demonstration) on multiple monitors
	in the same time without cloning the entire screen. The laptop's panel
	remains fully available to do any other stuff. 

DEPENDENCIES
	
	Required:
		- gtk+ (>=3.0)
		- python2 (>= 2.4)

	Optional (but recommended):

		- libxi (>=1.5)
