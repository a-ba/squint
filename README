INTRODUCTION

	squint is command that duplicates the output of a monitor into a X11
	window.


	The  very  purpose of such a gadget is to allow displaying a
	presentation (or making any kind of demonstration) on multiple monitors
	in the same time without cloning the entire screen. The laptop's panel
	remains fully available to do any other stuff. 

REQUIREMENTS
	
	- gtk+  (version 2 or 3)	

	- python

	- txt2tags gzip  (optional, needed for the man page)

INSTALLATION

	The build script is based on *waf*. To build squint, you need to run:

		./waf configure
		./waf
	
	Then, as root:

		./waf install

	By default squint is installed into /usr/local. You can configure this
	with the --prefix option when running "./waf configure"

	For more details run "./waf --help" or check the documentation at:
	http://docs.waf.googlecode.com/git/book_17/single.html
