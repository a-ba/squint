Some ideas :
- adjust the offset in configure-event
- implement a drop-down menu to show/edit the config at runtime
- catch XRandr update events and react accordingly
- completely hide the window when running in fullscreen mode
- integration with the session manager / ensure there is only one instance
- support Wayland (sometime in the future)
