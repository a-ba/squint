squint - duplicate a monitor output into a X11 window
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<P>

<B>squint</B> [ MONITOR_NAME ]
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<P>

<B>squint</B> is command that duplicates the output of a monitor into a X11
window.
<P>
<P>

The very purpose of such a gadget is to allow displaying a presentation (or
making any kind of demonstration) on multiple monitors in the same time
<I>without cloning the entire screen</I>.
<P>
<P>

Your laptop panel remains fully available to do any kind of work. You can
switch back and forth between the two screens just by minimising and restoring
<B>squint</B>'s window.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USAGE</H2>

<P>
<P>

By default <B>squint</B> assumes that the external screen is the monitor having
the smallest resolution. This should be the most typical configuration
(duplicating a monitor into a smaller one looks less interesting). If you are
in that case, then you just need to run the command without any parameter:
<P>
<PRE>
        squint
</PRE>

<P>
<P>
<P>

If the monitor you wish to duplicate is not the smallest one or if there is
only one monitor (maybe you enjoy the Larsen effect), then you need to state
which monitor (as listed by the <B>xrandr</B> command) shall be duplicated.
<P>
<PRE>
        squint HDMI1
</PRE>

<P>
<P>
<P>

The window displayed by <B>squint</B> provides no interactions at all, it is just
a view of the monitor output. In order to interact with the content displayed
in this monitor, the pointer must be moved into this monitor.
