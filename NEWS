Version 0.8.0	29/01/2021

Improvements
	- improved cursor rendering
	  (the 8-bit alpha channel is now fully handled)
	- optimisation: redraw only the damaged part of the window
	  (instead of redrawing the whole window)

Bugfixes
	- fixed races (should no longer crash with BadMatch X11 errors)

Housecleaning
	- migrated the build script to meson
	- migrated to the Ayatana AppIndicator library
	- removed dependency on libinotify (use glib instead)
	- prepared the code to migrate away from X11
	  (all X11-specific code now in a separate module)

Other changes
	- changed the default monitor selection
	  (the leftmost monitor is now assumed to be the primary monitor
	  instead of relying on the primary screen as reported by gdk)


Version 0.7.1	20/06/2016

Bugfixes:
	- fixes for building with gcc 5.4


Version 0.7	27/02/2014

Improvements
	- the periodic timer was removed (thanks XDamage & XInput), this brings
	  smoother motions, better performances and less power consumption
	- the cursor icon from the source screen is now cloned into the
	  destination screen (instead of drawing a crosshair)
	- the window (in fullscreen mode) is now completely hidden
	- the window (in window mode) is now resizable
	- errors are reported on screen using freedesktop notifications
	- the location of the active_window is tracked to ensure that it is in
	  on screen when there is activity on the keyboard
	- duplication is stopped when there is a change in the XRandr configuration

New features
	- an icon in the system tray allows controlling the app at runtime:
		- enable/disable duplication
		- choose a different source/destination screen
		- toggle fullscreen mode
		- quit
	- screen duplication can be disabled ad startup by using -d (useful
	  for launcing squint at the X session startup)
	- it is possible to clone a source screen with a resolution which is
	  larger than the destination screen (the window will slide)
	- the refresh rate can be tuned/limited in the command line

Other changes
	- by default squint uses the primary monitor (as reported by gdk) as the
	  destination screen (instead of choosing the largest screen)
	- dropped Gtk2 compatibility
